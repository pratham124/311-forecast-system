# Use Case UC-16: Indicate Degraded Forecast Confidence in UI

**Goal in Context**: Clearly indicate in the user interface when forecast confidence is degraded (e.g., due to shocks, missing data, or abnormal conditions) so operational managers do not over-rely on point forecasts.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Data Quality Monitor, Visualization Module, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Forecasts are displayed while degraded confidence conditions exist.

---

## Success End Condition
* UI displays a clear indicator that forecast confidence is degraded.  
* Operational Manager understands that uncertainty is elevated.

## Failed End Condition
* Confidence degradation cannot be assessed or displayed; system logs the issue and shows forecasts without degradation indicator.

---

## Preconditions
* Forecast confidence metrics or quality signals are available.  
* Visualization services are operational.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Operational Manager opens a forecast visualization.  
2. System retrieves forecast data and associated confidence or quality signals.  
3. System detects degraded confidence conditions (e.g., missing inputs, shocks, anomalies).  
4. System prepares a visual confidence indicator (e.g., warning banner, icon, or message).  
5. System displays the forecast with the degradation indicator in the UI.  
6. System logs the display of degraded confidence status.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Confidence signals unavailable  
  * 2a1: System logs missing confidence data.  
  * 2a2: No degradation indicator is shown.  

* **3a**: False degradation signal  
  * 3a1: System validates and dismisses the signal.  
  * 3a2: Forecast shown normally.  

* **4a**: Visualization rendering error  
  * 4a1: System logs rendering failure.  
  * 4a2: Indicator not displayed.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Whenever forecasts are viewed  
* **Open Issues**: Definition of degradation thresholds and UI design standards not yet finalized.

# UC-16 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Indicate Degraded Forecast Confidence in UI

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

An operational manager opens a forecast dashboard to review upcoming demand. Alongside forecast values, the system retrieves associated confidence indicators and data quality signals.

The system evaluates these signals and detects degraded confidence conditions. Examples include missing recent input data, abnormal demand shocks, model instability, or unresolved anomalies.

Because forecast reliability is reduced, the system prepares a visual warning indicator. This may appear as a banner, icon, shaded uncertainty region, or explanatory message describing why confidence is lower than normal.

The forecast visualization is displayed together with the degradation indicator. The manager immediately understands that uncertainty is elevated and avoids relying solely on point estimates.

The system logs that degraded confidence status was detected and displayed.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Confidence Signals Unavailable

The manager opens the forecast view, but the system cannot retrieve confidence or quality signals due to missing data, monitoring failure, or processing issues.

The system logs the missing confidence signal condition.

Forecast values are displayed without a degradation indicator because the system cannot assess confidence state.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — False Degradation Signal

The system initially flags a degradation condition based on an anomaly or signal.

Further validation determines the issue does not materially affect forecast reliability.

The system dismisses the false degradation signal, logs the validation result, and shows the forecast normally without a warning.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Visualization Rendering Error

The system successfully detects degraded confidence and prepares the visual indicator.

However, the visualization module fails to render the indicator due to UI or charting issues.

The system logs the rendering failure.

The forecast may still be displayed, but the degradation warning does not appear.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- Degraded confidence indicators are shown only when supported by reliable signals  
- Missing or invalid signals are logged  
- The system avoids displaying misleading warnings  
- The operational manager either sees a valid caution indicator or a normal forecast view, with system transparency preserved
