# Use Case UC-03: Generate 1-Day Demand Forecast

**Goal in Context**: Provide a next 24-hour demand forecast per service category (and geography when available) so operational planning decisions can be made for staffing and dispatch.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Operational Manager requests a demand forecast or a scheduled forecast generation event occurs.

---

## Success End Condition
* A 1-day demand forecast is generated and available, broken down by service category and geography when data supports it.

## Failed End Condition
* No forecast is produced; the system logs the failure and retains the most recent valid forecast.

---

## Preconditions
* Valid historical and current operational data is available.  
* Forecasting models are configured and operational.  
* Required computational resources are available.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Operational Manager initiates a forecast request or a scheduled process triggers forecast generation.  
2. System retrieves the latest validated operational data.  
3. System prepares input features for the forecasting model.  
4. System runs the forecasting engine to predict demand for the next 24 hours.  
5. System aggregates forecast results by service category.  
6. System further segments results by geography where data is available.  
7. System stores the generated forecast in the Data Storage System.  
8. System marks the forecast as current and available for operational use.  
9. System logs successful forecast generation.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

An operational manager needs to plan staffing and dispatch for the next day. At the scheduled forecast time, or after manually initiating a request, the system begins the forecast generation process.

The system retrieves the most recent validated operational data, including historical service request volumes, categories, and geographic information where available.

Next, the system prepares input features required by the forecasting model. This includes aggregating recent trends, applying time-based transformations, and aligning data with model input requirements.

The forecasting engine processes the prepared data and produces demand predictions for the next 24 hours. The output includes projected service request volumes.

The system aggregates these predictions by service category to show expected workload per service type. Where geographic data is available, the system further breaks down the forecast by location to support localized planning.

The completed forecast is stored in the operational data repository and marked as the current forecast.

The system logs successful generation, including timestamp and model execution details. The operational manager can now use the forecast to plan staffing and dispatch.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Required Data Unavailable

The forecast process begins, but the system cannot retrieve required operational data — for example, recent validated datasets are missing or incomplete.

Because reliable input data is not available, the system does not proceed with feature preparation or model execution.

The system logs the missing data condition and marks the forecast generation attempt as failed.

The previous valid forecast remains available for operational reference.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Forecasting Engine Error

The system retrieves and prepares data successfully. However, during model execution, the forecasting engine encounters an error such as a runtime failure, model configuration issue, or computational resource problem.

The system stops forecast processing and logs the model execution failure.

No new forecast is stored. The previous forecast remains active for dashboards and operational planning.

---

## Alternative Scenario 6a — Geographic Data Incomplete

The system successfully runs the forecasting model, but the input data lacks sufficient geographic detail.

The system generates a forecast segmented by service category only. Geographic breakdowns are omitted.

The system logs the limitation and marks the forecast as partially segmented. The forecast is still stored and made available for operational planning.

---

## Alternative Scenario 7a — Storage Failure

The forecast is successfully generated and segmented. When the system attempts to store the forecast, a storage failure occurs due to database outage, permission issues, or capacity limits.

The system logs the storage error and marks the run as failed.

The newly generated forecast is not marked as current. The previous forecast remains active.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all failure scenarios:

- No incomplete or unreliable forecast replaces the current valid forecast  
- Previously valid forecasts remain available  
- Failures are logged for monitoring and investigation  
- Operational continuity and decision reliability are prioritized
