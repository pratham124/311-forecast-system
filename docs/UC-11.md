# Use Case UC-11: Notify on Abnormal Demand Surge Detection

**Goal in Context**: Notify operational managers when a surge detection mechanism identifies abnormal demand (“storm mode”) so they can respond even if the spike was not fully forecasted.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Surge Detection Module, Notification Service, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Surge detector flags abnormal demand conditions.

---

## Success End Condition
* System detects abnormal demand and sends a surge notification to the operational manager.  
* Event is logged for monitoring and review.

## Failed End Condition
* Surge detection event is not evaluated or notification fails; system logs the failure.

---

## Preconditions
* Surge detection logic is configured and operational.  
* Notification channels are available.  
* Current demand data is being monitored.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Surge Detection Module monitors incoming demand data in real time.  
2. Surge Detection Module identifies demand patterns that exceed abnormality thresholds.  
3. System confirms a surge condition (“storm mode”).  
4. System creates a surge notification event with relevant details (category, geography, magnitude, time).  
5. Notification Service sends alert to the operational manager.  
6. System logs successful notification delivery.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Surge detection error  
  * 2a1: System logs detection module failure.  
  * 2a2: No notification is sent.  

* **3a**: False positive filtered  
  * 3a1: System determines surge condition not valid.  
  * 3a2: No notification is sent.  

* **5a**: Notification delivery failure  
  * 5a1: System logs delivery failure.  
  * 5a2: System marks event for retry or manual review.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Event-driven (whenever abnormal demand is detected)  
* **Open Issues**: Surge detection thresholds and notification retry policies not yet finalized.

# UC-11 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Notify on Abnormal Demand Surge Detection

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

The system continuously monitors incoming demand data through the surge detection module. This module analyzes real-time demand patterns across service categories and geographic areas.

A sudden increase in demand is detected that exceeds abnormality thresholds defined in the surge detection logic. The system confirms that the pattern represents an abnormal demand surge (“storm mode”) rather than normal variation.

The system creates a surge notification event containing relevant details such as affected service category, geographic area, magnitude of deviation, and time of detection.

The notification service sends an alert to the operational manager through the configured channel, such as a dashboard alert, email, or SMS.

The system logs the successful delivery of the surge notification. The operational manager can now take immediate action to respond to the unexpected spike.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Surge Detection Error

The surge detection module encounters a processing error — for example, data stream interruption or computational failure.

The system logs the detection module failure and does not attempt to confirm a surge condition.

No notification is generated.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — False Positive Filtered

The surge detection module initially flags an abnormal demand pattern, but additional validation logic determines the increase is due to normal variation or data noise.

The system cancels the surge alert and logs that the event was filtered as a false positive.

No notification is sent to the operational manager.

---

## Alternative Scenario 5a — Notification Delivery Failure

A valid surge condition is confirmed and a notification event is created. However, the notification service fails to deliver the alert due to connectivity issues or service outage.

The system logs the delivery failure and marks the event for retry or manual review.

The surge is detected, but the operational manager does not receive the notification at that time.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- Notifications are sent only for confirmed abnormal demand events  
- Detection or delivery failures are logged for monitoring  
- The system prioritizes accurate alerts over excessive false alarms  
- Operational managers are informed of meaningful demand surges when possible
