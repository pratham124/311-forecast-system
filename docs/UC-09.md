# Use Case UC-09: Overlay Weather Data on Forecast Explorer

**Goal in Context**: Provide an optional weather data overlay (e.g., temperature, snowfall) on the forecast explorer so operational managers can relate demand patterns to weather events.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Weather Data Service, Forecasting Engine, Visualization Module, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Operational Manager enables the weather overlay option in the forecast explorer.

---

## Success End Condition
* Weather data is displayed alongside forecast and historical demand data.  
* Operational Manager can visually correlate demand patterns with weather events.

## Failed End Condition
* Weather overlay cannot be retrieved or displayed; system logs the failure and displays forecast data without the weather layer.

---

## Preconditions
* Forecast visualization is available.  
* Weather data service is accessible.  
* Geographic and time alignment rules are defined.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Operational Manager opens the forecast explorer.  
2. Operational Manager selects the option to enable the weather overlay.  
3. System retrieves relevant weather data for the selected time range and geography.  
4. System aligns weather data with forecast and historical demand data on a common timeline and geography.  
5. System prepares combined data for visualization.  
6. System renders weather data as an overlay on the forecast explorer (e.g., lines, bands, or markers).  
7. System displays the updated visualization to the Operational Manager.  
8. System logs successful weather overlay rendering.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Weather data unavailable  
  * 3a1: System logs missing weather data.  
  * 3a2: System displays forecast visualization without weather overlay.  

* **4a**: Alignment issue between weather and demand data  
  * 4a1: System logs alignment error.  
  * 4a2: System displays forecast without weather overlay.  

* **6a**: Visualization rendering error  
  * 6a1: System logs rendering failure.  
  * 6a2: System displays error state.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium  
* **Frequency**: As needed during forecast analysis  
* **Open Issues**: Weather variables supported and resolution of geographic matching not yet finalized.

# UC-09 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Overlay Weather Data on Forecast Explorer

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

An operational manager is reviewing demand forecasts and wants to understand whether weather events might influence demand patterns. The manager opens the forecast explorer.

Within the interface, the manager enables the optional weather overlay feature.

The system retrieves relevant weather data — such as temperature and snowfall — corresponding to the selected time range and geographic area.

The system aligns the weather data with forecast and historical demand data using common time intervals and geographic boundaries.

The visualization module prepares a combined view, layering weather information as lines, bands, or markers alongside forecast curves.

The updated visualization is displayed. The manager can now visually correlate spikes or dips in demand with weather events.

The system logs successful rendering of the weather overlay.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — Weather Data Unavailable

The manager enables the weather overlay, but the system cannot retrieve weather data due to service outage, missing records, or connectivity issues.

The system logs the missing weather data condition.

The forecast explorer continues to display forecast and historical demand data without the weather overlay. A message indicates that weather data is currently unavailable.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Alignment Issue Between Weather and Demand Data

Weather data is retrieved successfully, but the system encounters issues aligning it with demand data — for example, mismatched time resolution or incompatible geographic definitions.

The system logs the alignment error and does not apply the overlay.

The forecast visualization remains visible without weather data.

---

## Alternative Scenario 6a — Visualization Rendering Error

Weather data and demand data are retrieved and aligned successfully. However, the visualization module encounters a rendering error when attempting to display the overlay.

The system logs the rendering failure and displays an error state or removes the weather layer.

No weather overlay is shown.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all failure scenarios:

- The system avoids displaying misleading or misaligned overlays  
- Forecast visualization remains usable even if weather data fails  
- Errors and limitations are clearly logged  
- Data integrity and interpretability are prioritized over partial overlays
