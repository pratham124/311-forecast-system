# Use Case UC-15: Incorporate Weather and Major Events into Forecast Uncertainty and Alerts

**Goal in Context**: Ensure the system accounts for weather conditions and major events (e.g., storms) when calculating forecast uncertainty and generating alerts, so operational managers receive more cautious forecasts and higher alert sensitivity during “storm mode.”  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Surge Detection Module, Weather/Event Data Service, Notification Service, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Weather conditions or major events are detected, or forecasts are generated during such conditions.

---

## Success End Condition
* Forecast uncertainty bands reflect weather/event influence.  
* Alert sensitivity is adjusted appropriately.  
* Operational Manager receives alerts aligned with storm conditions.

## Failed End Condition
* Weather/event influence is not applied; system logs the issue and continues using standard forecasting and alert logic.

---

## Preconditions
* Weather and event data sources are accessible.  
* Forecasting and alerting systems support adaptive logic.  
* Storm/event detection criteria are defined.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. System monitors weather and event data feeds.  
2. System detects conditions indicating a major weather event or storm.  
3. System activates “storm mode” adjustments.  
4. Forecasting Engine incorporates weather/event factors into uncertainty calculations.  
5. Alert logic increases sensitivity thresholds where appropriate.  
6. System generates forecasts with expanded uncertainty bands.  
7. System evaluates demand conditions with updated sensitivity.  
8. Notification Service sends alerts based on adjusted logic.  
9. System logs storm mode activation and adjusted operations.

## Extensions
* **1a**: Weather/event data unavailable  
  * 1a1: System logs missing external data.  
  * 1a2: System continues with standard forecasting logic.  

* **2a**: Event falsely detected  
  * 2a1: System validates and rejects false trigger.  
  * 2a2: Storm mode not activated.  

* **4a**: Forecast adjustment failure  
  * 4a1: System logs model adjustment error.  
  * 4a2: Forecast uses standard uncertainty.  

* **8a**: Notification failure  
  * 8a1: System logs delivery failure.  
  * 8a2: Event marked for retry.

# UC-15 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Incorporate Weather and Major Events into Forecast Uncertainty and Alerts  

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

The system continuously monitors weather feeds and major event data sources. A severe storm system is detected that meets predefined storm mode criteria.

The system validates the event and activates “storm mode.” This signals that external conditions may significantly affect service demand.

The forecasting engine adjusts its calculations to incorporate weather and event-related factors. Uncertainty bands are widened to reflect increased variability in demand.

At the same time, alerting logic becomes more sensitive in relevant service categories or geographic areas. This ensures that potential spikes are flagged earlier.

The system generates updated forecasts with expanded uncertainty ranges. It evaluates demand conditions using the adjusted thresholds.

When elevated demand risk is detected under storm mode logic, the notification service sends alerts to the operational manager.

The system logs storm mode activation, forecast adjustments, and alert events. The operational manager receives more cautious forecasts and timely alerts during the storm.

---

## Alternative Scenario 1a — Weather/Event Data Unavailable

The system attempts to retrieve weather or event data but encounters a service outage or missing feed.

The system logs the missing external data condition.

Storm mode cannot be activated, so the system continues using standard forecasting and alert logic.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Event Falsely Detected

Weather/event monitoring initially flags a potential storm condition.

Additional validation determines the event does not meet storm mode criteria.

The system cancels storm mode activation and logs that the trigger was rejected.

Forecasting and alert logic continue operating normally.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Forecast Adjustment Failure

A storm event is confirmed, but the forecasting engine fails to incorporate weather/event factors due to model or processing issues.

The system logs the model adjustment error.

Forecasts are generated using standard uncertainty calculations, and storm-specific adjustments are not applied.

---

## Alternative Scenario 8a — Notification Failure

Storm mode is active and alert logic detects elevated demand risk. A notification event is created.

However, the notification service fails to deliver the alert.

The system logs the delivery failure and marks the event for retry.

Although storm-adjusted logic was applied, the operational manager does not receive the alert at that time.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- Storm mode adjustments are applied only when reliable external data supports them  
- Failures in external data, validation, forecasting, or notification are logged  
- Standard logic remains as a fallback when storm mode cannot operate  
- System prioritizes reliability and transparency in high-risk situations
