# Use Case UC-10: Notify on Forecast Demand Threshold Exceedance

**Goal in Context**: Notify operational managers when forecasted demand for a service category (and optionally a geographic region) exceeds a configurable threshold so they can prepare for demand spikes.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Notification Service, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Forecast results are generated or updated.

---

## Success End Condition
* System detects threshold exceedance and sends a notification to the operational manager.  
* Event is logged for monitoring.

## Failed End Condition
* Threshold exceedance is not evaluated or notification fails; system logs the failure.

---

## Preconditions
* Forecast data exists.  
* Threshold values are configured.  
* Notification channels are operational.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. System generates or updates forecast results.  
2. System evaluates forecasted demand against configured thresholds by category and optional geography.  
3. System detects that demand exceeds the defined threshold.  
4. System creates a notification event.  
5. System sends notification to the operational manager.  
6. System logs successful notification delivery.

---

## Extensions
* **2a**: Thresholds not configured  
  * 2a1: System logs configuration issue.  
  * 2a2: No notification is sent.  

* **3a**: No threshold exceedance  
  * 3a1: System takes no action.  

* **5a**: Notification delivery failure  
  * 5a1: System logs delivery failure.  
  * 5a2: System marks event for retry or manual review.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Whenever forecasts are updated  
* **Open Issues**: Notification channels and retry policies not yet finalized.

# UC-10 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Notify on Forecast Demand Threshold Exceedance

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

New forecast results are generated by the system. The operational manager has previously configured threshold values for specific service categories and, optionally, geographic regions.

The system automatically evaluates forecasted demand values against these configured thresholds. For a particular category (and possibly geography), the forecasted demand exceeds the defined threshold.

Recognizing this as a potential demand spike, the system creates a notification event containing relevant details such as the category, geography, forecasted value, threshold value, and time window.

The notification service sends an alert to the operational manager through the configured channel (e.g., dashboard alert, email, or SMS).

The system logs the successful delivery of the notification. The operational manager can now prepare staffing and dispatch adjustments in advance.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Thresholds Not Configured

Forecast results are generated, but no thresholds have been defined for the relevant categories or geographies.

The system logs a configuration issue and does not evaluate exceedance conditions.

No notifications are sent.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — No Threshold Exceedance

The system evaluates forecasted demand values against configured thresholds.

All forecast values remain within acceptable limits.

The system takes no notification action and simply logs the evaluation outcome if required.

---

## Alternative Scenario 5a — Notification Delivery Failure

The system detects a threshold exceedance and creates a notification event. However, the notification service fails to deliver the alert — for example, due to connectivity issues or service outage.

The system logs the delivery failure and marks the event for retry or manual review.

Although the exceedance was detected, the operational manager does not receive the notification at that time.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- Notifications are only sent when valid threshold conditions are met  
- Misconfigurations or delivery failures are logged  
- System reliability and traceability are prioritized  
- Operational managers are informed of meaningful demand spikes when possible
