UC-1

- Every narrative is a valid, plausible instantiation of a documented flow and correctly supports the user story’s goal.

- The set of scenarios cover all flows listed in the use case.

- No, it is missing the scenario where when we are fetching the latest 311 service request data but the returned data is empty. 

Prompt to address:
“Update UC-01 by adding an Extension for the case where the 311 API returns successfully but there are no new records since the last successful pull. Then write a fully dressed scenario narrative for that new extension, maintaining the Cockburn style and existing end conditions.”

Response:
* **4b**: Data source returns no new records  
  * 4b1: System logs that no new records were available.  
  * 4b2: System keeps the current dataset unchanged and marks the run as successful. 
  ## Alternative Scenario 4b — No New Data Available

Authentication succeeds and the API responds, but indicates there are no new records since the last pull.

The system logs that no new data was available, keeps the current dataset unchanged, and marks the run as successful.

**→ Satisfies Success End Condition (dataset verified current).**

- No, there were no scenarios that represent a flow not documented in the use case.

UC-2

- Every narrative is a valid, plausible instantiation of a documented flow and correctly supports the user story’s goal. 

- The set of scenarios cover all flows listed in the use case.

- The set of scenarios fully accomplish the use case as intended.

- No, there were no scenarios that represent a flow not documented in the use case.

UC-3

- Every narrative is a valid, plausible instantiation of a documented flow and correctly supports the user story’s goal. 

- The set of scenarios cover all flows listed in the use case.

- No, it is missing the scenario where a forecast is already current for the same 24-hour window and the manager requests again. 

Prompt to address:
“Update UC-03 by adding an extension for the case where a request is made but a current forecast for the next 24 hours already exists. Then write a fully dressed scenario narrative for that extension.”

Response:
* **1a**: Current 24-hour forecast already exists  
  * 1a1: System retrieves the existing forecast without rerunning the model.  
  * 1a2: System logs that a current forecast was served. 
## Alternative Scenario 1a — Forecast Already Current

An operational manager requests a 1-day forecast. The system checks the forecast store and finds a forecast already marked as current for the upcoming 24-hour window.

Instead of rerunning the forecasting engine, the system retrieves the existing forecast and presents it for operational planning.

The system logs that an existing current forecast was served.

**→ Satisfies Success End Condition.**

- No, there were no scenarios that represent a flow not documented in the use case.

UC-4

- Every narrative is a valid, plausible instantiation of a documented flow and correctly supports the user story’s goal. 

- The set of scenarios cover all flows listed in the use case.

- No, it is missing the scenario where a forecast is already current for the same 7-day window and the manager requests again. 

Prompt to address:
“Update UC-03 by adding an extension for the case where a request is made but a current forecast for the next 7 days already exists. Then write a fully dressed scenario narrative for that extension.”

Response:
* **1a**: Current 7-day forecast already exists  
  * 1a1: System retrieves the existing forecast without rerunning the model.  
  * 1a2: System logs that a current weekly forecast was served.  
## Alternative Scenario 1a — Weekly Forecast Already Current

An operational manager requests a weekly forecast. The system checks the forecast store and finds a forecast already marked as current for the next seven-day horizon.

Instead of rerunning the forecasting engine, the system retrieves the existing forecast and presents it for planning.

The system logs that an existing current weekly forecast was served.

**→ Satisfies Success End Condition.**

- No, there were no scenarios that represent a flow not documented in the use case.


UC-5

- Every narrative is a valid, plausible instantiation of a documented flow and correctly supports the user story’s goal. 

- The set of scenarios cover all flows listed in the use case.

- The set of scenarios fully accomplish the use case as intended.

- No, there were no scenarios that represent a flow not documented in the use case.

UC-6

- Every narrative is a valid, plausible instantiation of a documented flow and correctly supports the user story’s goal. 

- The set of scenarios cover all flows listed in the use case.

- No, we are missing the scenario where we have the data but the evaluation metric computation fails or produces invalid values.

Prompt to address:
“Update UC-06 by adding an extension for when evaluation metric computation fails or produces invalid values. Then write a fully dressed scenario narrative for that extension.”

Response:
* **5a**: Evaluation metric computation failure  
  * 5a1: System logs metric calculation issue (e.g., invalid values, divide-by-zero, insufficient data).  
  * 5a2: System excludes affected metrics or categories from results.  
  * 5a3: System continues evaluation for remaining valid metrics. 
## Alternative Scenario 5a — Metric Computation Failure

Data and model outputs are retrieved successfully, but one or more evaluation metrics cannot be computed due to invalid values, divide-by-zero, or insufficient data.

The system logs the issue and excludes affected metrics or categories. Remaining valid metrics are computed and aggregated.

Results are stored with notes about excluded metrics.

**→ Satisfies Success End Condition (partial evaluation with documented limitations).**

- No, there were no scenarios that represent a flow not documented in the use case.
