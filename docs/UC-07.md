# Use Case UC-07: Explore Historical 311 Demand Data

**Goal in Context**: Allow exploration of historical 311 service request demand by category, time range, and geography so planners can identify patterns and support capacity planning decisions.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: City Planner  
**Secondary Actors**: Data Storage System, Visualization Module  
**Trigger**: City Planner opens the historical demand analysis interface.

---

## Success End Condition
* Historical demand data is displayed based on selected filters for category, time range, and geography.  
* City Planner can view trends and patterns for planning purposes.

## Failed End Condition
* Historical data cannot be retrieved or displayed; system logs the failure and shows an error state.

---

## Preconditions
* Historical 311 data is stored and accessible.  
* Filtering and visualization services are operational.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. City Planner accesses the historical demand analysis interface.  
2. System displays available filtering options (service category, time range, geography).  
3. City Planner selects desired filters.  
4. System retrieves historical data matching the selected filters.  
5. System aggregates and prepares the data for visualization.  
6. System renders charts or tables showing historical demand patterns.  
7. City Planner reviews the displayed information.  
8. System logs successful data retrieval and visualization.

## Extensions
* **3a**: High data volume is requested.
  * 3a1: System detects that the selected filters will result in an exceptionally large dataset (e.g., city-wide data for a multi-year period).
  * 3a2: System displays a warning message alerting the City Planner that the request may take a significant amount of time to load or impact browser performance.
  * 3a3: City Planner acknowledges the warning and chooses to proceed.
  * 3a4: System proceeds to Step 4.

* **4a**: No data matches selected filters  
  * 4a1: System displays a no-data message.  
  * 4a2: System logs the condition.  

* **4b**: Data retrieval failure  
  * 4b1: System logs retrieval error.  
  * 4b2: System displays error state.  

* **6a**: Visualization rendering error  
  * 6a1: System logs rendering failure.  
  * 6a2: System displays error state.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium  
* **Frequency**: As needed for planning and analysis  
* **Open Issues**: Granularity of geographic segmentation and historical data retention policies not yet finalized.

# UC-07 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Explore Historical 311 Demand Data

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

A city planner wants to understand past 311 service demand to support capacity planning. The planner opens the historical demand analysis interface.

The system presents filtering options such as service category, time range, and geographic area. The planner selects specific service categories, defines a time period of interest, and chooses geographic filters if needed.

The system processes the request and retrieves historical 311 service request data matching the selected filters.

The system aggregates the data appropriately — for example, grouping by day, week, or month — and prepares it for visualization.

The visualization module renders charts or tables that display historical demand patterns. These visuals may show trends, peaks, seasonal fluctuations, or geographic concentrations.

The city planner reviews the information to identify patterns and inform planning decisions.

The system logs successful data retrieval and visualization.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — High Data Volume Warning
After the City Planner selects a multi-year time range covering the entire city, the system identifies that the resulting data volume exceeds the standard performance threshold.

Instead of immediately running the query, the system displays a warning notification. This message informs the planner that retrieving and rendering such a large volume of historical 311 records may result in a long wait time or cause the interface to become temporarily unresponsive.

The City Planner, requiring the full dataset for a comprehensive year-over-year capacity study, clicks "Proceed." The system then initiates the data retrieval process, showing a "loading" state to indicate that the request is being processed despite the size.

--- 

## Alternative Scenario 4a — No Data Matches Selected Filters

The planner applies filters, but the system finds no historical records matching the chosen criteria.

The system displays a clear message indicating that no data is available for the selected filters.

The system logs the condition for monitoring purposes. The planner may adjust filters and try again.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4b — Data Retrieval Failure

After the planner submits filter selections, the system attempts to retrieve historical data but encounters an error — such as database connectivity issues or service outage.

The system logs the retrieval failure and displays an error state instead of charts or tables.

No historical demand information is shown.

---

## Alternative Scenario 6a — Visualization Rendering Error

The system successfully retrieves and prepares historical data, but the visualization module encounters a rendering error — for example, charting service failure or client-side issue.

The system logs the rendering error and displays an error state.

Although data exists, it cannot be visualized for the planner.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all failure scenarios:

- The system avoids displaying misleading or incomplete information  
- Errors and limitations are clearly logged  
- The planner either sees valid historical data or a clear error/no-data message  
- Data integrity and clarity are prioritized over partial results
