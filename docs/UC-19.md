# UC-19 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Submit Feedback or Report a Bug  

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

A user encounters an issue or has feedback about the system. The user selects the feedback or report issue option in the interface.

The system displays a submission form that allows the user to describe the issue or provide feedback. The form may include fields such as description, category, and optional contact information.

The user enters the details and submits the form.

The system validates the input to ensure required fields are completed and formats are correct.

Validation succeeds. The system sends the submission to the feedback or issue tracking service used by the development team.

A record of the submission is stored in the system for tracking purposes.

The system confirms to the user that the feedback or bug report was successfully submitted.

The system logs the submission event.

---

## Alternative Scenario 5a — Invalid or Incomplete Input

The user submits the form with missing required information or invalid input.

During validation, the system detects the issue.

The system displays validation error messages indicating which fields must be corrected.

The submission is not processed until the user fixes the input.

---

## Alternative Scenario 6a — Issue Tracking Service Unavailable

The user submits valid input, but the external issue tracking or feedback service is unavailable.

The system logs the integration failure.

The submission is stored locally or queued for retry, and the user may be informed that the report was received but processing may be delayed.

---

## Alternative Scenario 7a — Storage Failure

The submission is valid and sent to the tracking service, but the system fails to store a local record due to storage issues.

The system logs the storage failure.

The user is notified that the submission may not have been fully recorded.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- User feedback and bug reports are captured whenever possible  
- Validation, integration, and storage issues are logged  
- Users receive clear feedback on submission status  
- System reliability and traceability of reports are prioritized
