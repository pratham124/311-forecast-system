# Use Case UC-17: View Public Forecast of 311 Demand by Category

**Goal in Context**: Allow public residents to view forecasts of 311 service demand by category so they can choose the fastest way to access services.  
**Scope**: Public-Facing Forecast Portal  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Public Resident  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Data Storage System, Visualization Module  
**Trigger**: Public resident opens the public forecast page.

## Success End Condition
* Forecast demand by service category is displayed in an understandable format.  
* Resident can interpret expected service load.

## Failed End Condition
* Forecast data cannot be retrieved or displayed; system logs the failure and shows an error state.

---

## Preconditions
* Public-safe forecast data is available.  
* Visualization services are operational.  
* Privacy and data filtering rules are applied.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Public Resident accesses the public forecast portal.  
2. System retrieves approved forecast demand data by service category.  
3. System prepares data for public visualization.  
4. System renders charts or summaries showing expected demand levels.  
5. Public Resident reviews the displayed information.  
6. System logs successful data retrieval and display.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Forecast data unavailable  
  * 2a1: System logs missing forecast data.  
  * 2a2: System displays error message.  

* **3a**: Data fails public-safety filtering  
  * 3a1: System removes restricted details.  
  * 3a2: System displays sanitized summary.  

* **4a**: Visualization rendering error  
  * 4a1: System logs rendering failure.  
  * 4a2: System displays error state.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Low  
* **Frequency**: As needed by public users  
* **Open Issues**: Level of detail and update frequency for public forecasts not yet finalized.

# UC-17 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** View Public Forecast of 311 Demand by Category  

---

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

A public resident wants to know how busy different 311 service categories are expected to be before deciding how to access services. The resident opens the public forecast portal.

The system retrieves forecast demand data that has been approved for public release. This data includes projected demand levels by service category but excludes sensitive operational details.

The system prepares the information in a simple, easy-to-understand format, such as charts, indicators, or summaries.

The visualization module displays expected demand levels for each service category, allowing the resident to see which services may experience higher demand.

The resident reviews the information and uses it to make an informed decision about the fastest way to reach services.

The system logs successful data retrieval and display.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Forecast Data Unavailable

The resident accesses the public portal, but forecast data cannot be retrieved due to system or data availability issues.

The system logs the missing forecast data condition.

An error message is displayed instead of forecast information.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — Data Fails Public-Safety Filtering

Forecast data is retrieved, but certain details do not meet public release rules.

The system removes restricted or sensitive information and logs the filtering action.

A sanitized summary is displayed to the resident, providing safe and general information.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Visualization Rendering Error

Forecast data is successfully retrieved and prepared. However, the visualization module encounters a rendering error.

The system logs the rendering failure.

An error state is shown instead of charts or summaries.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- Only approved and safe information is shown to the public  
- Missing data or rendering issues are logged  
- The resident either sees valid forecast summaries or a clear error message  
- Clarity and public data safety are prioritized
