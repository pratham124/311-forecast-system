## Main Success Scenario Narrative

A user wants to learn how to use the system’s features. The user selects the help or user guide option from the interface.

The system retrieves the latest version of the user guide from the documentation service or storage location.

The guide is presented in a readable format, such as a help page, document viewer, or embedded knowledge base.

The user navigates through the sections, reading instructions, examples, and explanations of system features.

The system logs successful access to the user guide.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Documentation Unavailable

The user selects the user guide option, but the system cannot retrieve documentation content due to missing files or service outage.

The system logs the missing guide content condition.

An error message is displayed instead of the guide.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — Display Rendering Error

The system successfully retrieves the user guide, but the interface encounters a rendering problem when displaying the content.

The system logs the rendering failure.

An error state is shown, and the guide content does not appear.

- The system provides instructional content when available  
- Missing documentation or rendering failures are logged  
- Users either see the guide or a clear error message  
- Usability and clarity are prioritized
