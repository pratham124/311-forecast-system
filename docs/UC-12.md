# Use Case UC-12: Drill Into Alert Details and Context

**Goal in Context**: Allow operational managers to drill into an alert and view forecast distribution, contributing drivers, and recent anomaly context so they can understand why the alert fired and determine appropriate actions.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Anomaly Detection Module, Visualization Module, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Operational Manager selects an alert for detailed review.

---

## Success End Condition
* Detailed alert context is displayed, including forecast distribution, key drivers, and recent anomaly information.  
* Operational Manager can interpret causes and plan actions.

## Failed End Condition
* Alert details cannot be retrieved or displayed; system logs the failure and shows an error state.

---

## Preconditions
* An alert event exists.  
* Forecast distribution data is available.  
* Driver attribution and anomaly context data are available.  
* Visualization services are operational.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Operational Manager opens the alert list.  
2. Operational Manager selects an alert for investigation.  
3. System retrieves forecast distribution data related to the alert.  
4. System retrieves driver attribution data explaining forecast influences.  
5. System retrieves recent anomaly detection context.  
6. System prepares combined data for visualization.  
7. System renders detailed views (distribution curves, driver breakdown, anomaly timeline).  
8. System displays the alert details to the Operational Manager.  
9. System logs successful alert detail rendering.

## Extensions
* **3a**: Forecast distribution data unavailable  
  * 3a1: System logs missing distribution data.  
  * 3a2: System displays available context without distribution view.  

* **4a**: Driver attribution data unavailable  
  * 4a1: System logs missing driver data.  
  * 4a2: System displays alert without driver breakdown.  

* **5a**: Anomaly context unavailable  
  * 5a1: System logs missing anomaly data.  
  * 5a2: System displays available alert information only.  

* **7a**: Visualization rendering error  
  * 7a1: System logs rendering failure.  
  * 7a2: System displays error state.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Whenever alerts are investigated  
* **Open Issues**: Definition of driver attribution methods and anomaly context windows not yet finalized.

# UC-12 Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives  
**Use Case:** Drill Into Alert Details and Context

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

An operational manager receives or notices an alert indicating unusual or high forecasted demand. To understand the situation, the manager opens the alert list in the system interface.

The manager selects a specific alert to investigate. The system retrieves detailed forecast distribution data related to the alert, showing ranges of possible demand outcomes rather than a single point estimate.

Next, the system retrieves driver attribution data that explains which factors most influenced the forecast. These drivers might include recent demand trends, seasonal effects, or external variables.

The system also retrieves recent anomaly detection context, such as unusual spikes or deviations observed in recent demand data leading up to the alert.

The visualization module prepares and displays a detailed view, including forecast distribution curves, a breakdown of contributing drivers, and a timeline of recent anomalies.

The operational manager reviews the information to understand why the alert fired and decides on appropriate staffing or dispatch actions.

The system logs successful retrieval and rendering of alert details.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — Forecast Distribution Data Unavailable

The manager selects an alert, but the system cannot retrieve forecast distribution data — for example, due to missing stored results or processing failure.

The system logs the missing distribution data condition.

The system still retrieves other available context and displays alert details without the distribution view.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Driver Attribution Data Unavailable

The system retrieves forecast distribution data successfully but cannot obtain driver attribution information.

The system logs the missing driver data condition.

The alert details are displayed without the driver breakdown.

---

## Alternative Scenario 5a — Anomaly Context Unavailable

Forecast distribution and driver data are retrieved successfully, but recent anomaly detection context is missing.

The system logs the missing anomaly context condition.

The alert details are shown without the anomaly timeline.

---

## Alternative Scenario 7a — Visualization Rendering Error

All required data is retrieved successfully. However, the visualization module encounters a rendering failure when attempting to display detailed views.

The system logs the rendering error and displays an error state.

No detailed alert view is shown.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- The system presents as much reliable context as available without showing misleading information  
- Missing components are clearly logged  
- The manager either sees valid alert context or a clear error/limitation message  
- Decision support integrity is prioritized over partial or incorrect displays
