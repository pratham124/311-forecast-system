# Use Case UC-13: Configure Alert Thresholds and Notification Channels

**Goal in Context**: Allow operational managers to configure alert thresholds and preferred notification channels so alerts fit their workflow and avoid excessive or duplicate notifications.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Notification Service, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Operational Manager opens alert configuration settings.

---

## Success End Condition
* Alert thresholds and notification preferences are saved and applied.  
* Future alerts follow the configured rules.

## Failed End Condition
* Configuration cannot be saved; system logs the failure and retains previous settings.

---

## Preconditions
* Operational Manager has access permissions.  
* Notification channels are available and supported.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Operational Manager accesses alert configuration settings.  
2. System displays current threshold values and notification channel options.  
3. Operational Manager adjusts thresholds for selected categories and optional geographies.  
4. Operational Manager selects preferred notification channels (e.g., email, Slack, Teams).  
5. Operational Manager configures frequency or deduplication preferences.  
6. Operational Manager saves the configuration.  
7. System validates settings.  
8. System stores updated configuration.  
9. System logs successful configuration update.

## Extensions
* **7a**: Invalid threshold values  
  * 7a1: System displays validation error.  
  * 7a2: Configuration is not saved.  

* **4a**: Unsupported notification channel selected  
  * 4a1: System displays error message.  
  * 4a2: Channel selection is rejected.  

* **8a**: Storage failure  
  * 8a1: System logs storage error.  
  * 8a2: Previous configuration remains active.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: Medium  
* **Frequency**: As needed when updating preferences  
* **Open Issues**: Deduplication rules and notification escalation policies not yet finalized.

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

An operational manager wants to ensure alerts are meaningful and delivered through preferred communication channels. The manager opens the alert configuration settings in the system.

The system displays current alert thresholds for service categories and optional geographic areas, along with available notification channels such as email and optional integrations (e.g., Slack or Teams).

The manager adjusts threshold values to better match operational capacity and tolerance for demand spikes. The manager then selects preferred notification channels and configures preferences such as notification frequency limits or deduplication settings.

After reviewing the settings, the manager saves the configuration.

The system validates the new thresholds and channel selections to ensure they are within allowed ranges and supported.

Validation succeeds. The system stores the updated configuration and confirms the changes.

The system logs the successful configuration update. Future alerts now follow the manager’s defined preferences.

---

## Alternative Scenario 7a — Invalid Threshold Values

The manager enters threshold values that fall outside acceptable limits — for example, negative values or unrealistic levels.

During validation, the system detects the invalid entries.

The system displays a validation error message indicating which values are incorrect and why.

The configuration is not saved. The manager must correct the values before proceeding.

---

## Alternative Scenario 4a — Unsupported Notification Channel Selected

The manager selects a notification channel that is not supported or not properly integrated.

During validation, the system detects the unsupported channel.

The system displays an error message explaining that the selected channel cannot be used.

The channel selection is rejected, and the configuration cannot be saved until a supported channel is chosen.

---

## Alternative Scenario 8a — Storage Failure

The manager successfully enters valid thresholds and channel selections, and validation passes.

When the system attempts to store the updated configuration, a storage failure occurs — such as database outage or permission issue.

The system logs the storage error and informs the manager that the configuration could not be saved.

The previous configuration remains active.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all scenarios:

- Only valid and supported configurations are applied  
- Errors are clearly communicated to the manager  
- Failures are logged for monitoring  
- Previous configurations remain active to prevent inconsistent alert behavior
