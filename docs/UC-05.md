# Use Case UC-05: Visualize Forecast Curves with Uncertainty Bands

**Goal in Context**: Provide forecast curves with uncertainty bands (e.g., P50/P90) overlaid on historical data so operational managers can assess expected demand, confidence levels, and plan for high and low scenarios.  
**Scope**: Operations Analytics System  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Operational Manager  
**Secondary Actors**: Forecasting Engine, Visualization Module, Data Storage System  
**Trigger**: Operational Manager opens the forecast visualization dashboard.

---

## Success End Condition
* Forecast curves and associated uncertainty bands are displayed alongside historical data.  
* Operational Manager can visually interpret expected demand and variability.

## Failed End Condition
* Forecast visualization cannot be generated; system logs the failure and displays the most recent available visualization or an error state.

---

## Preconditions
* A valid forecast dataset exists.  
* Historical data is available.  
* Visualization services are operational.

---

## Main Success Scenario
1. Operational Manager accesses the forecast dashboard.  
2. System retrieves the latest forecast data including uncertainty metrics (e.g., P50, P90).  
3. System retrieves relevant historical demand data.  
4. System aligns forecast and historical data on a common time axis.  
5. System renders forecast curves.  
6. System overlays uncertainty bands on the forecast curves.  
7. System displays the combined visualization to the Operational Manager.  
8. System logs successful visualization rendering.

## Extensions
* **2a**: Forecast data unavailable  
  * 2a1: System logs missing forecast data.  
  * 2a2: System displays error message or last available visualization.  

* **3a**: Historical data unavailable  
  * 3a1: System logs missing historical data.  
  * 3a2: System displays forecast curves without history overlay.  

* **6a**: Uncertainty metrics missing  
  * 6a1: System renders forecast curve without uncertainty bands.  
  * 6a2: System logs limitation.

* **5a**: Visualization rendering error  
  * 5a1: System logs rendering failure.  
  * 5a2: System displays error state.

## Related Information
* **Priority**: High  
* **Frequency**: Whenever forecasts are reviewed  
* **Open Issues**: Definition of uncertainty band levels and visualization standards not yet finalized.

**Use Case:** Visualize Forecast Curves with Uncertainty Bands

## Main Success Scenario Narrative

An operational manager opens the forecast dashboard to review upcoming demand. The system loads the most recent forecast dataset, which includes central estimates (such as P50) and higher-confidence bounds (such as P90).

The system also retrieves relevant historical demand data for the same service categories and time range. It aligns the historical data and forecasted time periods along a common timeline.

The visualization module renders the historical demand curve first, providing context for past trends. It then overlays the forecast curve for the upcoming period.

Next, the system displays uncertainty bands around the forecast curve. These bands visually represent expected variability and confidence ranges in predicted demand.

The operational manager can now see likely demand levels, understand the range of possible outcomes, and plan staffing and dispatch for normal, high, or low demand scenarios.

The system logs successful rendering of the visualization.

---

## Alternative Scenario 2a — Forecast Data Unavailable

The operational manager opens the dashboard, but the system cannot retrieve a valid forecast dataset — for example, forecast generation previously failed or data is missing.

The system logs the missing forecast condition. It either displays the most recent available visualization or an error message indicating that forecast data is not currently available.

No new visualization is generated.

---

## Alternative Scenario 3a — Historical Data Unavailable

The system successfully retrieves forecast data, but historical data cannot be loaded — due to missing records or data retrieval failure.

The system logs the missing historical data condition.

The visualization module renders the forecast curve and uncertainty bands only, without the historical overlay. The operational manager still sees projected demand but without past trend comparison.

---

## Alternative Scenario 6a — Uncertainty Metrics Missing

The forecast dataset loads successfully, but uncertainty metrics (such as P50/P90 values) are not available.

The system logs the limitation and renders the forecast curve alone without uncertainty bands.

The operational manager can still view predicted demand but cannot assess forecast confidence visually.

---

## Alternative Scenario 5a — Visualization Rendering Error

All required data is retrieved successfully, but the visualization module encounters a rendering error — such as charting service failure or client-side rendering issue.

The system logs the rendering failure and displays an error state instead of the visualization.

No forecast curves or uncertainty bands are shown.

---

## Key Behavioral Theme Across All Alternatives

Across all failure scenarios:

- The system avoids displaying misleading or incomplete visualizations  
- Limitations or errors are clearly logged  
- The user either sees the most reliable available data or an explicit error state  
- Data integrity and transparency are prioritized over partial or uncertain display
